## Q1: Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.❓

### ❇ Ans:



#### 1. 1985 - DNS:

DNS, or the Domain Name System is like a phone book for the internet. When we type a domain name on the browser like google.com, DNS translates the URL into an IP address so that the browser can contact to that address to request online contents.

Before DNS, people had to remember IP address to get information from the internet. DNS made internet use easy and user friendly.

#### 2. 1989 - WWW:
WWW, or the world wide web is the collection of online contents where each content is in HTML format and we can access it via web browsers using the internet.

Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in 1989 to easily share experiment data with fellow scientists. He relied on three main technologies namely HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), URL (Uniform Resource Locator), and HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to make www work. 

[WWW info link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)


#### 3. 1991 - First web page created
Berners-Lee first published public website in 1991. The purpose of the website was to explain what the world wide web is and the use of it.

This is really an important event because despite having the opportunity to sell the technology, Sir Berners-Lee makes it an open source and made a great contribution for a better connected world.

#### 4. 2005 - YouTube:

YouTube is a video sharing platform based on America but widely popular throughout the earth. Chad Hurley, Steve Chen, and Jawed Karim co-founded YouTube in 2005. It started as an entertainment video sharing platform but now-a-days we can find all sort of tutorials and educational material here. I belive YouTube has helped people to dream of a world where education will be free for everyone.

#### 5. 1995 - Internet phone:

Internet phones also known as broadband phone was introduced back in 1995 and was developed by Vocal Tech Communications Ltd. Similar to traditional phone, we use this technology for communication using voice but it uses the internet instead of electrical energy. It is most widely used Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application device. It was one of the stepping stone for current days Skype, zoom, canvas, google meet etc.

## Q2:Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
  - packets
  - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
  - routers and routing
  - domains and DNS

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.❓
 
  
### ❇ Ans:

#### * packets:
Packets are how we get content from the internet. When we request a piece of information such as a website all the content arrives as a series of packets. Normally a packet has 1000 to 1500 bytes in it. Each packet contains information about its source, destination, how many packets are coming and the number of the particular packet. Packets help make internet faster as it breaks the whole content into smaller pieces.
[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet)

#### * IP addresses: 
IP Address, or the Internet Protocol Address is used to identify a unique machine on a network. When we request any information from the internet, the request contains our local machine IP address and the IP address where it can get the information. IP address like a physical address made it possible to send data to a destination.

#### * Routers and routing
Router is a network hardware that helps to connect home device with the internet. It is used as a first line of security to protect computer system and information from external attack. And routing is the process that routers use to find a path to send traffic.
[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing))
[source](hhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing)

#### * Domains and DNS 
A domain name is a unique identifying address that is used to visit websites. And the Domain Name System or DNS is like a phone book for the internet. When we type a domain name on the browser like google.com, DNS translates the URL into an IP address so that the browser can contact to that address to request online contents.

[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System)

## Q3: Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
  - TCP
  - HTTP and HTTPS
  - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet ❓: 

#### * TCP:
TCP stands for Transmission control protocol. It maintains a connection with the host computer to the destination server via the port number with the guarantee to secure packets delivery. It considered as one of the main protocols of the Internet Protocol Suite as this makes sure the data is in the right order and none are missing. Which ensures the quality of communication between client and server.
[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol)

#### * HTTP AND HTTPS
HTTP, or The Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that help to transfer data over the World Wide Web. HTTP also clarify how data are formatted and transmitted. It also defines what response should a browser take when it receives the data. While HTTP is unsecured, HTTPS, or the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is secured. It protects the integrity and privacy of the data during communication between server and client.
[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS)

#### * web browsers:
A web browser is an application that we use to get content from the World Wide Web including webpages, images, video, and other files. When we request any information by typing domain address, it receives the requested content from the internet as HTML format and then display the information on a page. It makes communication between client and server really easy and user friendly.

 ## Q4:Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.❓
 ❇ Three Data structures Used in Ruby Programming are:
  - **Array**: An array is a collection that stores a list of values. It can store all kinds of items in a specific order unless something is done to change the order. The most useful function of an array is retrieving an element by the way of referring to its position. Setting a new element to a position or overwriting is another useful act of an array. 
  ***info link*** ➡️ [Array](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/built_in_classes/arrays.html)
  - **Hash**: A useful form of storing objects similar to a dictionary where values are signed to keys so that values can be looked up by their key. Looking up a value by the key is one big function of hash. Two hashes can be merged by using `.merge` method and the value can be retrieved later by using `.fetch` method.
   ***info link*** ➡️ [Hash](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/built_in_classes/hashes.html)
  - **Binary trees**: The binary tree is an advanced level data structure of ruby that contains two child nods that may include references to their parents.

 ## Q5:  Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.❓
### ❇ Ans:

In the world of computer science to do any kind of work we need to send the command to the computer. If I assume that a member of human species lands on an alien planet with a broken spaceship. Now the human needs some help from the alien but no one understands others language. We need a "middle man" helping hand to translate the need of humans to the member of the fellow alien species. If we suppose the alien friend is the computer and the instruction list to fix the spaceship is the command to be passed on,  this is where the explanation of  "Interpreter" and "compiler" starts. Suppose there are two types of helping robots that can translate the situation in the alien language.

The interpreter will take the list of notes from humans and will translate it step by step to the alien language and then the alien fellow will do that step. This one step at a  time method can keep going until the work is done. And if by any chance human gives a wrong note, there is enough time to correct that by giving the right notes to Interpreter and let the alien do it again until the work is finished happily. Though it is a little slower in the end the space ship is all ready to fly up high again without any bigger harm.

On the other hand, the Compiler will take the list of notes, will translate the whole at once, and will say bye-bye. All this might be a little more time consuming but after this everything is going to be very fast. After handing over the translated list to the alien friend, he can fix the spaceship so fast without any interruption.  Now if the human gave some wrong instruction by mistake that was translated by the compiler, there is no way to stop the alien friend for correcting the problem because the compiler is not there anymore. So in the end, there is a big chance of doing big harm to that spaceship. The process seems faster but there is a big chance of doing it all wrong while working with the compiler. 

This is the exact way the interpreter and the compiler work on the computer.
#### Interpreter:
The Interpreter is a computer program that starts right away, takes its time to run while translating the command, and gives the chance of fixing any mistakes by giving the chance of monitoring the result. The interpreter is always in between the program and the computer. It translates line by line.
#### Compiler:
The compiler is the program that takes an extra long time to prepare the translation all at once but after that, the program will run very quickly. Compiler piles together with the entire program and translates the whole thing all at once.

 ## Q6:  TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.❓
 ### ❇ Ans:
 
 TWO commonly used programming languages:
 1.  Ruby
2.  Java 
 
 Ruby:
 - Dynamicly typed  language
 - Interpreted language
 - `require` statement is used to import a package or a module
 - null value is declared with `nil`
 - In Ruby, everything is an object

Java:
- Staticly typed language
- Compiled language
-  `import` statement is used to load a package
-  null value is declared with `null`
-  In Java, only classes have objects

 ## Q7: Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue.

List of topics containing ethical issues:
  - access to a user’s personal information (medical, family, financial, personal attributes such as sexuality, religion, or beliefs)
  - intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement.
  - criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited substances, terrorism
  - GPS tracking data and other types of metadata, MAC addresses, hardware fingerprints
  - freedom of thought, conscience, speech and the media
  - aggressive sales and marketing practices designed to mislead and deceive consumers
  - trading of shares on the stock exchange OR crypto-currencies

For each ethical issue identify a source of legal information relating to the ethical issue and discuss whether the law is helpful in assisting a developer to act in an ethical way.

Conduct research into a case study of ONE of the ethical issues you have chosen discuss how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches.❓
 ### ❇Ans:
 I think the following two issues are relevent to IT professionals.

Access to user's personal information ( medical, family, financial, personal attributes such as sexuality, religion, or beliefs)
  - Australian privacy laws are contained in a variety of Commonwealth, State and Territory Acts. The "Privacy Acts" are data protection laws which regulate the collection, use and disclosure of personal information about individuals; they do not protect privacy of the individual in a broader sense. Many companies follow this and encript data and arrange training for developer to handle personal data carefully so that an individual developer can not access it. So In my opinion, there are enough knowledge out there for a developer to help with make a ethical decession. 

GPS tracking data and other types of metadata, MAC address, hardware fingerprints.
  - Internet and other telecommunications services, ISPs and telephone service providers who mainly have access to user location, Mac address and hardware fingnerprints are also required to comply with the privacy protection provisions of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (C'th) and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 (C'th). A variety of other legislation contains privacy protection provisions relevant to particular types of entities and/or practices, for example, the Spam Act, surveillance and listening devices acts, and many others. Companies are pro active to follow this and encript data and arrange training for developer to handle personal data carefully so that an individual developer can not access it. So In my opinion, there are enough knowledge out there for a developer to help with make a ethical decession. 

Case Study: 

An investigation into Vodafone Hutchison Australia following allegations that customer information had been compromised showed that the company’s business model provided access to the company’s databases of customer information to dealership employees via a shared store login ID.

Although the use of shared logins and the wide availability of full identity information is an inherent personal information security risk, in this instance the risk was increased by the fact that the entity had less control over information being accessed through dealerships, and no way of tracking or auditing who was accessing the information.

To prevent this IT professional could flag that issue when building the feature and could suggest instead of showing the information without individuals permission, it could ask permisson from user weather they want to show their information on different dealership stores.

 ## Q8:Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language❓
### ❇ Ans:

Control flow is the order in which individual function calls of a program are exicuted.The control flow distinguishes an imperative programming language from a declarative programming language.

Within an imperative programming language, a control flow statement is a statement that results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths to follow. For non-strict functional languages, functions and language constructs exist to achieve the same result, but they are usually not termed control flow statements.
 
 
 
 
 --- 
 ## Q9:  Explain type coercion❓
 ### ❇ Ans:
 
 Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another (such as strings to numbers).  An example would be the conversion of an integer value into a floating-point value or its textual representation as a string, and vice versa. Each programming language has its own rules on how types can be converted. Languages with strong typing typically do a little implicit conversion and discourage the reinterpretation of representations, while languages with weak typing perform many implicit conversions between data types. Weak typing language often allows forcing the compiler to arbitrarily interpret a data item as having different representations—this can be a non-obvious programming error or a technical method to directly deal with the underlying hardware.
 [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_conversion)

 ## Q10: Describe the data types recognised by the Ruby programming language. In your description you should give example code which uses each data type, and include the name of the Ruby classes which represent each data type. ❓
 ### ❇ Ans:
 
 The data types recognised by the Ruby programming language are:
* **Booleans**

 In Ruby, a boolean refers to a value of either true or false of their very own data types. Every appearance of truth in a Ruby program is an instance of TrueClass, while every appearance of false is an instance of FalseClass. There are three main boolean operators in ruby: 
* ! ("single-bang") representing "NOT",  for example: !true #=> false
* && ("double-ampersand") representing "AND", for example: true && true #=> true
* || ("double-pipe") representing "OR". 

To check if two values are equal, we use the comparison operator represented with == ("double-equal-sign"). If two values are equal, then the statement will return true. If they are not equal, then it will return false.

[source](https://learn.co/lessons/booleans-ruby-readme)

* **Symbols**

A symbol looks like a variable name prefixed with a colon. Ruby uses symbols and maintains a Symbol Table to hold them. Symbols are names - names of instance variables, names of methods, names of classes. So if there is a method called control_movie, there is automatically a symbol :control_movie. Ruby's interpreted, so it keeps its Symbol Table handy at all times. You can find out what's on it at any given moment by calling Symbol.all_symbols.
We can also transform a String into a Symbol and vice-versa:

`puts "string".to_sym.class # Symbol  `
`puts :symbol.to_s.class    # String `

* **Numbers**

Ruby integers are objects of class Fixnum or Bignum. The Fixnum and Bignum classes represent integers of differing sizes. Both classes descend from Integer (and therefore Numeric). The floating-point numbers are objects of class Float, corresponding to the native architecture's double data type.
[source](http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/numbers_in_ruby.html)

* **Strings**

A string is a sequence of a bunch of characters that may consist of letters, numbers, or symbols.
In Ruby, strings are objects, which are mutable, which means they can be changed in place instead of creating new strings. 
For printing a string the bunch of characters is written  like this
print "This is a string."
or, puts "This is a string which will make a line break at the end."
[source](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-work-with-strings-in-ruby)

* **Arrays**

Arrays are like bags that contain things in order which can be multidimensional. Counting on array starts with zero index, which means the first item in array is index zero, the next one is index one. It is Array class object. 
words = ["one", "two", "three"]
puts words[0] => one
[source](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/built_in_classes/arrays.html)

* **Hashes**
 
 A Hash assigns values to keys so that values can be looked up by their key like a dictionary. In Ruby you can create a Hash by assigning a key to a value with =>, separate these key/value pairs with commas and enclose the whole thing with curly braces. The class of this type of object is the Hash class.
This is how it looks:
{ "one" => "a", "two" => "b", "three" => "c" }
[source](http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/built_in_classes/hashes.html)

 ##  Q12: Identify and explain the error in the following code that is preventing correct execution of the program❓    
     celsius = gets
     fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
     print "The result is: "
     print fahrenheit
     puts "."
     
     
     
 ### ❇ Ans: 
 
 Here, `Celsius` is storing a string as an input which can not be coerced into integer. The stored input needs to convert into integer.
 The correct code is
  ` celsius = gets.to_f`
    `print "The result is: "`
    `fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32`
    `print fahrenheit`
    `puts '.'`

 ## Q13: The following code looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly. ❓
 ### ❇ Ans:
 
 `arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]`
 `i = 0`
 `while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])`
  `i = i + 1 end`
 `puts i`
 `item = arr[i]`
 `arr[i] = arr[i + 1]`
 `arr[i + 1] = item`
 

 ## Q14: Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:
  i. Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations

 ## Q15:Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem:

You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.	❓
 ### ❇ Ans:
 ### **Ruby code:**
 
 ``` writting code:
 def weather(temperature, raining)
  if temperature < 15
    if raining
      puts "It’s wet and cold"
    else 
      puts "It’s not raining but cold"
    end
  elsif temperature >= 15
